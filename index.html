				<b> Health care factors </b>
				<p>Health is a fundamental driver of our overall quality of life. We thus focus on factors affecting health, globally and country wise, the expenditure in these directions and trends over these factors in the past few years. 
				How the world population is changing is of great importance for humanity’s impact on the Earth’s natural environment, but it also gives reasons to hope for a good future. This is because we have a bigger team of better educated people who can contribute to the solutions that improve global well-being.

				<b> Causes of death </b>
				<p>As the population grows, causes of death accross the world are changing. The data visualisations attempt to provide a comparison between causes and risk factors of death across countries and age groups. We observe that Non Communicable diseases not only dominate mortality figures at a global level, but also account for the majority of deaths in high-income countries. Deaths from causes such as infectious disease, malnutrition, nutritional deficiencies, neonatal and maternal deaths in high-income countries is typically very low in relative terms.</p>

				<b> HealthCare Expenditure </b>
				<p>Global expenditure on healthcare as a share of world income has been increasing, steadily but slowly over the course of the last couple of decades.In the background, however, there has been substantial cross-country heterogeneity, both in levels and trends. Regionally, high-income countries spend – and have been spending – a much larger share of their income on healthcare than low-income countries (about twice as much).</p>
